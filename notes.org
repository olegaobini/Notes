  *Container*
    /a linux container contain applications in a way to keep them isoloated from the host system that they run on./
    /Containers allow developers to package up an application with all of th eparts it needs, such as libraries/
    /and other dependencies. And ship it all out as one package./

    The host operating system is software on a computer that works with the underlying hardware

          - [X] POP3
            - Post Office Protocol v3
            - a protocol for receiving email by downloading it to your computer from a mailbox on the server of an Internet service provider.
            - POP3 downloads the email from a server to a single computer, then deletes the email from the server.
            - Only use if all emails are required offline

          - [X] IMAP
            - Simply put, IMAP (Internet Access Message Protocol) is an email protocol that deals with managing and retrieving email messages from the receiving server.
            - Can't use IMAP to send emails.

**** WPA I, II, III                                          :wpa:encryption:
     
     [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wi-Fi_Protected_Access#WPA][WI-FI Protected Access]] (WPA), (WPA2), and (WPA3) are three security and security certification
     programs developed to secure wireless computer networks.
     
     - *WPA*: A security certification program that is implemented in the firmware of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wireless_network_interface_card][wireless network interface cards]]
     - *WPA2*: In 2004, WPA2 replaced WPA. it includes mandatory support for CCMP, an AES-based encryption mode
     - *WPA3*: A Replacement to WPA2 which uses the new standard uses an equivalent 192-bit cryptographic strength in WPA3-Enterprise mode

**** Universal Plug and Play (UPnP)
    
     *Universal Plug and Play* /(UPnP) is a set of networking protocols that permits networked devices, such as personal computers, printers,/
     /Internet gateways, WI-FI access points and mobile devices to seamlessly discover each other's presence on the network and establish/
     /functional network services for data sharing, communications, and entertainment. UPnP is intended primarily for residential networks/
     /without enterprise-class devices./ [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Plug_and_Play#:~:text=Universal%20Plug%20and%20Play%20(UPnP,network%20services%20for%20data%20sharing%2C][Universal Plug and Play - Wikipedia ]]   
     
     - VERY BAD DON"T USE THIS

*** Hardware                                                       :hardware:
**** PCIe                                                              :PCIe:
     
     *PCIe* (peripheral component interconnect express) is an interface standard for connecting high-speed components. [[https://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/pcie-definition,5754.html][What Is PCIe? | Tom's Hardware]] 
     
     *Can Be used to connect*
     - Personal Graphics Cards
     - RAID Cards
     - WI-FI Cards
     - SSD add on cards

     PCIe slots can come in different configurations. x1, x4, x8, x16, x32.
     these are how many lanes the PCIe slots have.

     A PCIe x2 slot has two lanes and can move data at two bits per cycle (and so on).

*** Hardware and Network Troubleshooting
**** Blue Screen of Death (BSOD)                    :windows:troubleshooting:
     
     [[https://www.howtogeek.com/163452/everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-blue-screen-of-death/][The Blue Screen of Death]] (BSOD) is always an unwelcome sight. BSODs appear when Microsoft Windows encounters a critical error from which it can’t
     recover, usually the result of low-level software (or drivers) crashing or faulty hardware.

     Blue screens are generally caused by problems with your computer’s hardware or issues with its hardware driver software.

     When a blue screen occurs, Windows automatically creates a “minidump” file that contains information about the crash and saves it to your disk. 
     
***** Troubleshooting
      
**** Netstat                                                        :windows:
    
     delivers basic statistics on all network activities and informs users on which ports and addresses the corresponding connections (TCP, UDP) are running
     and which ports are open for tasks.
